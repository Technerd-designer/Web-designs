                        Our Strategic Research Department undertakes policy research and analysis to increase stakeholders' knowledge through generation of research evidence,which forms
                        a major input to economic,social and other policy-making processes in the country.Both demand and supply-driven research is planned and implemented,with the
                        intention to respond to the socio-economic changes and advance knowledge in key areas of national,regional or global importance.
                        <br>
                        The research agenda is therefore shaped by the evolving economic policies,the dynamics of political governance and the emerging social economic challenges emanating from
                        the changing economic environment in Tanzania,the EAC and worldwide.The research is also dictated by emerging global issues that have increased the need for research based evidence.
                        <br>
                        Our annual plans are geared towards carrying out rigorous and policy oriented research that generates new insights and options for promoting policies that facilitate
                        mineral-related inclusive growth.
